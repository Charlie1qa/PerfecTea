### The Quest To Create the Perfect Cup of Tea!!

In 2018 we have tried to solved several of the worlds biggest problems, we have cars in space, we can order pizza online and have it delivered to our doors but we have one last limitation to overcome.....a good....no wait...Perfect cup of tea! Follow the adventure at @Perfec_Tea on twitter.

## How?

The machine is based upon a paper by the BSA to create the ideal cup of tea, to be used to compare different tea types. From this we have developed a way to create your ideal brew in 3 strengths. 

Place your tea into the infuser. Add hot water into your regular ~~viking horn~~ cup and placed in the machine. You select your required strength and size of cup, then you relax and let the machine take care of the rest. Add milk to taste. 

For more detailled instructions on how to build PerfecTea please see our Wiki.
